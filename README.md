# ADA 447 Midterm Project - Fine-tuning a Vision Model for Cat or Dog Breed Classification

Project Overview
1. Downloading and examining the data.
2. Creating the DataBlock with appropriate transformations.
3. Tuning and training the model, I do this by using transfer learning.
4. Applying advanced techniques, one of which is discriminative learning rates.
5. Examining and interpreting the model outputs.
6. Finally, deploying the model using Gradio
